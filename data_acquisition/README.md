To be able to provide the reference bounding boxes for the new tool, we first have to find the bounding boxes of the manipulated objects relative to the tracker.

We provide a docker installation for the method, sample data and ipython notebook where individual steps are demonstrated. For details see the [Trace extractor README.md](./trace-extractor/README.md)

### 3a) Extracting images from the bag files


### 3b) Processing the extracted images
